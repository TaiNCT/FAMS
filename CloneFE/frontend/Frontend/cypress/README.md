# Cypress folder ?

If you are still developing the frontend, don't worry about this, [Cypress]() is just a very convenient tool to help you do End-to-End testing or Unit Testing ( in the frontend scenario, it's "Component testing" ).<br>
Once you have finished coding a component, you can either push it to Gitlab or you can choose to unit test it first to make sure it works like a charm in multiple cases, your choice !
<br>
But either way, i would highly recommend doing E2E testing since that will replicate the exact button clicks, and keyboard presses that a normal user will perform onto the entire website. This kind of test should be done when both the API endpoints and the frontend has completed

## How to run ?

that's easy, simply call

```
npm run test
```

then write your tests. If you are still confused at how to write tests, just watch some youtube videos or read the [Cypress docs]().
